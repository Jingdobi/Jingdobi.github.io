                <p>
                    The target audience for this weather project will be for anyone that wants to go star gazing at night. 
                    The typical crowd of people that would want to go stargazing is huge, ranging from young kids wanting to look at stars, to 
                    older astronomy experts that want to know the next night to see a star coming near. The age range will be 12-65 years.

                <h3>Rashid - 14 year old boy</h3>
                <p>
                    Rashid is working on his astronomy merit badge. As part of the requirements for it, he has to spend at least three nights looking
                    at star constellations. He has already spent two nights with his scout troop on camp-outs looking at stars, and he only needs one
                    more night to complete his requirements. Unfortunately, there has been an inversion causing clouds to cover the sky for weeks. 
                    Rashid looks up Stargazers.cc to find there is a single day next week that the sky will by just clear enough to get his merit badge!

                <h3>Harriet - 32 year old woman</h3>
                <p>
                    Harriet moved to Norway to live with her husband at 28 years old, and hasn't been able to see her family since. She just got
                    a call from her mother that her parents were coming out to see her. Harriet is so excited to see them again, and wants to show
                    them all the wonderful sights in Norway. Because her parents are from a big city, she wants to show them how beautiful the sky is 
                    in a pollution light environment. She opens up Stargazers.cc to find the perfect day to show them!
                </p>
                <h3>Brock - 22 year old young man</h3>
                <p>
                    Brock is bored of playing video games every weeknight and wants to convince his friends to do something else. He hears about a
                    meteor shower happening through the week and learns that it will extend into the weekend as well. He wants to make sure to go on the
                    a best night so his friends will be impressed with him, and they could turn it into a recurring activity. He checks Stargazing.cc to find 
                    the best night to go!
                </p>
                <h3>Howard - 25 year old man</h3>
                <p> When Howard met Sherry, he knew that she was the one. It was never a question of if, but always when they should get engaged. Howard thinks
                    that it's been enough time for the both of them, and they have talked about marriage. He thinks about what would be the most memorable way to propose.
                    He decides that he would like to propose at the top of one of their favorite hiking spots. He thinks it would be perfect to be looking at the stars with 
                    his best friend on a clear night to ask the question :). 
                </p>
                <h3>Gwen - 45 year old mother</h3>
                <p>Raising 2 kids is a hard job for a mother. She has to make plans for every occasion and make sure everyone gets to their respective
                    favorite sports on time. Lately she's been having a hard time connecting with her oldest 16 year old daughter. Gwen remembers when her 
                    family would take her out to look at the stars, and she would be so enamored with the view that she couldn't help expressing her feelings. 
                    Gwen finds the best night to go out with her daughter on Stargazers.cc and tells her husband what night she's going out.
