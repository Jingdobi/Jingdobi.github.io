                <b>The</b> last thing you might think about a recycling company is how nice their website looks. WeRecycle has a delightful home
                page that loads in with a small recycling truck, and gives you a grand picture to look at with a bold title next to it. Yet even 
                with the large entrance it doesn't feel like too much. There is a lot of white space in the top between the image and the heading. 
                It balances out the large carnival picture and loud heading.

                <b>It's</b> no surprise that a multimillion corporation would have a nice website. What McDonalds excels at here though, is their
                remarkable consistency in style and color. Almost every interactive element in the website is highlighted bright yellow. This both
                lets you know it's ok to click on, and highlights the company's main color. There is also a sharp pop of red that periodically
                shows up, giving a great example of contrast.
